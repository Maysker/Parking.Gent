# Parking.Gent
## About

Parking.Gent is an SPA created as a learning project with the aim of improving urban parking space in Ghent. The project utilizes open data and APIs to simplify parking searches. This is the first step towards a more ambitious digital project for transforming urban mobility. When designing the appearance and interface of the application, special attention was paid to Ghent's cultural and historical heritage, seamlessly blending culture, art, and cutting-edge technologies to make the application aesthetically appealing and reflective of the city's spirit.
## Key Features

    Automatic search for the nearest parking based on user geolocation.
    Parking search by address using geocoding.
    Displaying parking information, including capacity and distance.
    Integration with Google Maps for navigation and routes.

## Technologies

    JavaScript and modern ES6+ syntax for efficient data handling.
    Use of OpenStreetMap and Project OSRM API for route and distance calculations.
    Fetch API for retrieving data from Ghent's open APIs.
    Asynchronous programming using async/await to improve performance and code readability.
