# Parking.Gent
## About

Parking.Gent is an SPA created as a learning project with the aim of improving urban parking space in Ghent. The project utilizes open data and APIs to simplify parking searches. This is the first step towards a more ambitious digital project for transforming urban mobility. When designing the appearance and interface of the application, special attention was paid to Ghent's cultural and historical heritage, seamlessly blending culture, art, and cutting-edge technologies to make the application aesthetically appealing and reflective of the city's spirit.
